## Who we are:
We are a group of individuals who suffer from visual impairments and have designed a pair of bifocals that have a universal set of magnification levels.

## The problem we tackle:
Currently, there are no eyeglasses that have the capability to have a universal set of magnification levels and have no range for long-distance vision. We suffer the ailment of having to rely on prescription glasses that are constrained to certain magnifications which are not perfect. Our vision is frequently changing and so are our glasses. A product that can give people access to these levels of vision will solve the problem of necessity and convenience.

## What solutions we provide:
We provide a set of bifocal lenses that has the ability to adjust to any level of magnification for the user will ever need. This includes close-up or long-distance vision, it provides people with any set of vision they desire.

## What the competition fails to do:
Competitors such as Rodenstock and Essilor offer quality lenses but do not offer technology that adjusts to any magnification level. A single set of lenses are provided but are generally temporary as eyesight tends to worsen over time.
